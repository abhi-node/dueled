# Implementation Plan - Dueled (Revised)

## Overview
This document has been reorganized into three focused phases for more efficient development and clearer milestones. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation before moving to the next level of complexity.

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: MVP - Core Infrastructure & Matchmaking (Weeks 1-4)
**File**: `phase-1-mvp.md`

**Goal**: Build a functional MVP with complete frontend-to-backend connectivity, working WebSocket communication, and basic matchmaking system.

**Deliverable**: A main menu where two players can queue up and be matched together in the same world.

**Key Features**:
- Project setup and development environment
- Authentication system (login/register/anonymous)
- Basic UI components and main menu
- PostgreSQL database and Redis setup
- WebSocket communication with Socket.IO
- Matchmaking queue system
- Basic game world with Phaser 3
- Player representation and movement
- Real-time position updates

**Exit Criteria**: Two players can successfully queue, be matched, and see each other in the same game world.

### Phase 2: Combat System Implementation (Weeks 5-8)
**File**: `phase-2-combat.md`

**Goal**: Implement complete combat system with all four classes, their unique abilities, weapons, and balanced mechanics.

**Deliverable**: Full combat system with all four classes (Berserker, Mage, Bomber, Archer) implemented with balanced mechanics, visual effects, and responsive gameplay.

**Key Features**:
- **Berserker**: Sword with AOE slash, rage mode, high HP/armor
- **Mage**: Ice projectiles with slow effect, medium range
- **Bomber**: Explosive AOE attacks with armor burn
- **Archer**: High-velocity piercing arrows, long range
- Damage calculation and armor system
- Status effects (slow, burn, rage)
- Visual and audio effects
- Combat UI elements
- Anti-cheat and server-side validation
- Match management system

**Exit Criteria**: All four classes implemented with unique mechanics, balanced combat, and server-side validation.

### Phase 3: Polish & Deployment (Weeks 9-12)
**File**: `phase-3-polish-deployment.md`

**Goal**: Polish the complete combat system, optimize performance, ensure quality through comprehensive testing, and deploy to Vercel.

**Deliverable**: Production-ready Dueled game deployed to Vercel with polished combat functionality, optimized performance, and comprehensive quality assurance.

**Key Features**:
- Performance optimization (client, server, network)
- UI/UX polish and visual enhancements
- Audio system implementation
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Security testing and validation
- Vercel deployment setup
- CI/CD pipeline implementation
- Production infrastructure
- Monitoring and analytics
- Documentation and support systems

**Exit Criteria**: Production deployment successful on Vercel with all systems performing within target metrics.

## Development Approach

### Sequential Development
Each phase must be completed before moving to the next:
1. **Phase 1** establishes the foundation
2. **Phase 2** builds the core gameplay
3. **Phase 3** polishes and deploys

### Quality Gates
- Each phase has specific exit criteria
- Testing is integrated throughout
- Performance targets are defined per phase
- Security measures are implemented progressively

### Risk Mitigation
- Focused scope per phase reduces complexity
- Early testing prevents issues from propagating
- Incremental development allows for course correction
- Clear milestones provide progress visibility

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Phaser 3 for game engine
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for build tooling

### Backend
- Node.js + Express with TypeScript
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Redis for session management and queues

### Deployment
- Vercel for frontend and serverless functions
- Cloud database services (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Monitoring with Sentry and analytics

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Uptime**: >99.9% availability
- **Performance**: 60 FPS client, <100ms server response
- **Scalability**: 1000+ concurrent users
- **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities

### User Metrics
- **User Retention**: >70% return after first match
- **Match Completion**: >90% matches completed successfully
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.0/5.0 rating
- **Class Balance**: <10% win rate variance between classes

### Business Metrics
- **Launch Success**: Smooth deployment without major issues
- **User Growth**: Growing user base post-launch
- **System Stability**: No critical failures
- **Community**: Active user engagement

## Next Steps

1. **Review Phase 1 Plan**: Start with `phase-1-mvp.md`
2. **Begin Development**: Follow Week 1 tasks
3. **Track Progress**: Use milestone checkpoints
4. **Prepare for Phase 2**: Complete Phase 1 exit criteria

This restructured approach provides clearer focus, better risk management, and more achievable milestones while maintaining the comprehensive scope of the original plan.
